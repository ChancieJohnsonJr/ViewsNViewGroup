Singleton pattern - a class that is instantiated once where a single object is used by other classes Factory pattern - defines a class to create an object but the subclasses changes the type of objects that will be created or instantiated Builder pattern - uses a sequence of actions to make objects; it separates the construction of a complex object from its representation; it is a creational design pattern Facade pattern - structural design pattern; it may seem simple when exposed to client, but is very complex behind the interface; makes subsystem easy to use Prototype - used to make a number of instances of a class; creational design pattern; creates duplicate objects
ART and Dalvik differs in a number of ways. One way is their approach. ART uses ahead of time (not dynamic) to convert high level code into machine language while Dalvik uses just in time (dynamic) approach to compile a small portion of your code so it usually uses less physical space. Other differences are booting time (ART takes longer to reboot), space (ART uses more space during installation), battery usage (Dalvik uses more battery), and garbage collection (ART is better)
The android manifest is used for allowing permissions an app has to have in order to run any of the app's code. It also identifies the package name that aids the its SDK when the application is being constructed. The needed info is packaged in a JAR file. It also names the Java package for the application.
Runtime - is when the executable file is actually ran (occurs after compile time) Compile time - when code is converted into executable file (before run time)
sp - scale-independent pixels; similar to dp and is scaled based of preference of end user's font size dp - density-independent pixels; used whe defining application's user interface; ensures correct display on screen px - point per scale; maps to the screen pixel; corresponds to the actual pixels on the screen; dependent on density pt - 1/72 of an inch in - inches; based on physical size of screen mm - millimeters; based on physical size of the screen
The 4 layers in the Android platform architecture are:
kernel: provides support for security, process, device and memory management; lists drivers used to communicate with other devices
middleware: helps developers build apps more efficiently by hiding intricacies of distributed systems; provides common services and capabilities to the application; used in distributed systems
framework: provides APIs, Activity Manager, content providers, resource/location/notifications/telephony managers are found here
application: built-in or third party installed apps on device; any custom built apps found here too; Examples are: alarms, camera, media player, calculator, etc.
Reflection is when you examine and alter all of the possible things a class can do at runtime; this includes methods, fields, etc.
Gradle basically allows reusing of artifacts of exiting systems that are already created. It recognizes the tasks/dependencies needed to be executed and executes dependencies in order; parses the .pom file and downloads the AAR/JAR
